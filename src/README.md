# Adaptive Neural Stimulation System - Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the Adaptive Phase-Differential Brain Nerve Stimulation System. The system is designed to provide personalized, adaptive neural stimulation for various neurological applications including cognitive enhancement, motor rehabilitation, and more.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into several modules, each handling specific aspects of the system:

### Core Components

- `core/system_controller.py`: Central controller that coordinates all system components and manages the overall system state.

### Data Processing

- `data_processing/eeg_processor.py`: Processes EEG data, applies filters, and extracts features.
- `data_processing/neural_feedback.py`: Analyzes neural signals to provide real-time feedback for adaptive stimulation.

### Hardware Interface

- `hardware_interface/stimulation_device.py`: Interfaces with stimulation hardware and manages device communications.

### Stimulation Algorithms

- `algorithms/brainwave_sync.py`: Synchronizes stimulation with the user's brainwave patterns.
- `algorithms/plasticity_window.py`: Detects optimal timing for stimulation based on neural plasticity.
- `algorithms/spatiotemporal_patterns.py`: Generates complex stimulation patterns that follow natural neural pathways.

### Treatment Protocols

- `protocols/treatment_protocols.py`: Defines structured protocols for different treatment conditions.

### Visualization

- `visualization/stimulation_visualizer.py`: Provides visual representations of stimulation patterns and neural data.

### Application

- `app.py`: Main application script that brings all components together.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Brainwave Synchronization**: Stimulation is precisely timed to the user's brain activity patterns.
- **Neuroplasticity Window Detection**: Automatically identifies optimal timing for stimulation.
- **Complex Spatiotemporal Patterns**: Creates sophisticated stimulation sequences that follow natural neural pathways.
- **Neural Feedback Adaptation**: Continuously adjusts stimulation based on real-time neural responses.
- **Wireless Multi-site Stimulation**: Enables flexible placement of stimulation devices.
- **Condition-Specific Protocols**: Specialized stimulation patterns for different conditions.

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to the codebase, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code.
2. **Documentation**: All functions and classes should have docstrings in the Google style format.
3. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks with appropriate logging.
4. **Logging**: Use the logging module instead of print statements.
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality.
6. **Type Hints**: Use type hints to improve code readability and IDE support.

## Safety Considerations

This system is designed for research and clinical applications involving neural stimulation. Always adhere to the following safety guidelines:

1. Never exceed the maximum current limits defined in the configuration.
2. Always validate stimulation parameters before applying them.
3. Include appropriate safety mechanisms to prevent adverse effects.
4. Follow all applicable regulations and ethical guidelines for neural stimulation.
