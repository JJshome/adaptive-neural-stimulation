## Key Papers

### Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Neural Circuit Modulation

1. **Kumagai et al. (2025) - Vagus nerve stimulation as a predictive coding modulator that enhances feedforward over feedback transmission**
   - **Journal**: Frontiers in Neural Circuits
   - **Key findings**: VNS modulates the balance between feedforward and feedback processing, enhancing feedforward signal transmission. This mechanism is mediated through multiple neuromodulatory systems and facilitates neural plasticity and adaptive behavior.
   - **Relevance to our project**: Provides a theoretical framework for understanding how neural stimulation can enhance specific pathways in the brain, similar to our phase-differential approach.

2. **Goldenkoff et al. (2025) - Cerebellar activity affects distal cortical physiology and synaptic plasticity in a human parietal-motor pathway associated with motor actions**
   - **Journal**: The Journal of Neuroscience
   - **Key findings**: Shows how stimulation of one brain region (cerebellum) can modulate the plasticity of distant but connected neural circuits, demonstrating the potential for targeted neuromodulation.
   - **Relevance to our project**: Supports the concept that stimulation with specific parameters can affect the plasticity of neural circuits throughout the brain network.

3. **Chen et al. (2025) - Cortical plasticity, therapeutic effects, and neural circuit activity of angular gyrus rTMS in amnestic mild cognitive impairment**
   - **Journal**: Clinical Neurophysiology
   - **Key findings**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the angular gyrus improves cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment through enhanced cortical plasticity.
   - **Relevance to our project**: Demonstrates clinical efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation for cognitive disorders, which is one of our target applications.

### Brain Stimulation Techniques and Neural Plasticity

1. **Shi et al. (2025) - Erasing "bad memories": reversing aberrant synaptic plasticity as therapy for neurological and psychiatric disorders**
   - **Journal**: Molecular Psychiatry
   - **Key findings**: Reviews evidence that preventing or reversing maladaptive synaptic strengths could be a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders.
   - **Relevance to our project**: Provides theoretical support for using phase-differential stimulation to reorganize neural circuits in various brain disorders.

2. **Liu et al. (2025) - Cortical Plasticity Induced by Pairing Primary Motor Cortex Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With Subthalamic Nucleus Magneto-Acoustic Coupling Stimulation**
   - **Journal**: IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
   - **Key findings**: Demonstrates enhanced cortical plasticity through paired stimulation of the motor cortex and deep brain structures, with precise timing control based on spike timing-dependent plasticity.
   - **Relevance to our project**: Supports our approach of using precisely timed phase-differential stimulation to enhance neural plasticity and reorganize neural circuits.
